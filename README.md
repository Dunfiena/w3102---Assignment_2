## What is it? ##
This website is a project for the Web3102 class at NSCC.  It is a java servlet, SQL Database built to resemble an online retail store.
It has functions like adding items to a cart, login, register and the ability to select catergories to sort by.


I've implemented modals for login and register, like in the tskApp webapp for the same class, and I've also implemented it in a larger way
for displying item information.
